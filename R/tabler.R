#' @title tabler: a wrapper to quickly combine and share tidy regression output
#' @name tabler
#'
#' @description The tabler package is a tool used to make simple tables of
#'   regression output from multiple models that at least partially overlap in
#'   variables used. It reports coeffecients, test statistics for variables,
#'   and, if desired, model fit stats. It can output data as either csv or xls
#'   and is meant to allow analysts to easily and quickly arrange a series of
#'   regression outputs to share with collaborators.
